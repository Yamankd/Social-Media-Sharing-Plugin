# Plugin Development 
- Create a plugin in WordPress with a settings page where user can set the credentials of their social media account i.e. API Key, Secret etc. 

- Create a Connection button, clicking on which will establish a connection between the WordPress and that social media platform  

- Add  “Share to” checkbox, followed by the name of the social media (ex. Share To LinkedIn, Share To Facebook) on the default Posts menu. 

- Tick marking any of the checkbox should result in sharing the entire post on that particular social media platform, once the post is “Published” or “Updated” 

Use proper social media api keys and credentials required for each social media account integration.
